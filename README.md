# YOLOER_V2
YOLOER stands for You Only Look Once and Estimate Range while V1 implies the version of object detector (V2 = YOLOv7). The project is about REAL-TIME Object Detection and Distance/Depth Estimation using YOLOv7 object detector. To test the Real-Time functionality immediately, we provide the option of running the model on the webcam. Moreover, the options of testing on recorded videos and images are also provided.
